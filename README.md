This project was developed for the 2025 Capstone class. The idea behind this project is that we wanted to build a ecommerce website like Shopify and Squarespace but not having to have pay for certain features. Shopify and other major online storefronts often require payments to be made to change their site, often as simple as just placement of products. ThreadLine offers full customizability which is easier for new users to understand and to build their own storefront. Everything is here for the host, like admin dashboard, a way to manage products and other site options. This is a full stack developed project coded by Matthew Ostin with design contributions from Layan Sayyaad. ThreadLine can be visited @ threadline.it.com.
